# 169. Majority Element

"""
Brute Force Solution:
Use a counter hashmap to count the frequency of each value in the list nums, and then return the key with the maximum frequency
Time Complexity: O(n) for iterating thru the nums and count the frequency of each element, and O(n) to find the maximum frequency 
                iterating thru the hash map
                    =>  O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
Space Complecity: O(n) since for storing the frequencies in the hashmap is O(n) in the worst case, where each element in the list is unique.
